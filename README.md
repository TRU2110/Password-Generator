# Password-Generator

ðŸŒŸ**Project Overview**
The Password Generator is a web-based tool that enables users to create strong, random passwords. Users can specify the desired length and choose which character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) to include. The generated password can be copied to the clipboard with a single click.

ðŸŒŸ**Project Structure**

_The project consists of three main components_

1 **HTML:** Defines the structure and content of the webpage and sets up the basic layout of the Password Generator interface.
2 **CSS:** Styles the visual appearance of the webpage and the elements of the Password Generator, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
3 **JavaScript:** Implements the functionality for generating and copying passwords.
